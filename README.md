# LLM-Based-Customer-Segmentation-Dashboard
This is an LLM based customer segmentation dashboard. It utilizes an LLm to tokenize the features of each customers in a dataset.
The tokenized data are clustered using Kmeans algorithm to identify common features present in each cluster.

The steps implemented in the project are as follows:
- Tokenize each complete observation.
- Identify outliers using ECOD.
- Dimensionality reduction. The dimension of the dataset were reduced to 2 and 3 using PRINCE python library for easy visualization.
- Contribution of each features in each cluster.
- The insights obtained were explained in a table format.

The application can be check out [here](https://llm-based-customer-segmentation-dashboard-123.streamlit.app/).
The screen shot of the appliocation and the insights derived is show below. The insights were shared in a table format.
